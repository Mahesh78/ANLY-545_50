**a) Make a plot of Ratio over Year. What features stand out? Which plot do you prefer to display the tendency for more male births?**

``` r
library(HistData); library(ggplot2);
plot(Arbuthnot$Year, Arbuthnot$Ratio, xlab = "Year", ylab = "Ratio", type = "l", col = "dark green")
```

![](ANLY_545_50_HW_2_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png) From the plot and data, it could be inferred that ratio of male to female births are always above 1. This means there are more male births than females with the ratio peaking in 1661 and 1662. As shown, line plot is better at visualizing the trend when compared to histogram or scatter plot.

**b) Plot the total number of christenings, Males + Females or Total (in 000s) over time. What unusual features do you see?**

``` r
plot(Arbuthnot$Year, Arbuthnot$Total, xlab = "Year", ylab = "Total", type = "l", col = "dark red")
```

![](ANLY_545_50_HW_2_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png) This plot does not show constant increase in total. There are some ups and downs in the plot. There is a dip from 1640 until almost 1660 and again a sharp dip around 1704.

**c) Make a reasonable plot showing departure from the binomial distribution.**

``` r
library("vcd");

plot(goodfit(WomenQueue, type = "binomial"))
```

**d) Suggest some reasons why the number of women in queues of length 10 might depart from a binomial distribution, Bin(n = 10, p = 1/2)**

``` r
plot(goodfit(WomenQueue, type = "binomial", par = list(prob = .5,size = 10)))
```

![](ANLY_545_50_HW_2_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png) This is most likely due to smaller sample size that almost always results in skewed data.

**Carry out the GOF test for this fixed binomial distribution. What is the ratio of ??2/df? What do you conclude?**

``` r
summary(goodfit(Saxony, type = "binomial", par = list(prob = .5 ,size = 12)))
```

    ## 
    ##   Goodness-of-fit test for binomial distribution
    ## 
    ##                       X^2 df     P(> X^2)
    ## Pearson          249.1954 12 2.013281e-46
    ## Likelihood Ratio 205.4060 12 2.493625e-37

Ratio is 205.406/12 = 17.1. This can not be a binomial distribution since p &lt; 0.5.

**Additional test**

``` r
summary(goodfit(Saxony, type = "binomial", par = list(size = 12)))
```

    ## 
    ##   Goodness-of-fit test for binomial distribution
    ## 
    ##                      X^2 df     P(> X^2)
    ## Likelihood Ratio 97.0065 11 6.978187e-16

Ratio is 8.8 and p value is &lt; 0.5 so it is not binomially distributed.
